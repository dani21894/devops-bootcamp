Gate Tests & Branch Protection

1. Gate Test (Quality Gate)
What it is: An automated check (or series of checks) that code must pass before it is allowed to move to the next stage (e.g., merging into main or deploying to production).

Role: Acts as a security guard or checkpoint in CI pipeline. Common gate tests include:

Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests

Code linting and formatting checks

Security scans and dependency vulnerability checks

Goal: Ensures that bad, broken, or insecure code is caught immediately and blocked from contaminating the primary repository.

2. Branch Protection Rules
What it is: Repository configurations (set up in GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) that restrict who can push code directly to critical branches (like main or production).

Role: Establishes governance and enforces team workflows. Key settings typically include:

Blocking Direct Pushes: Developers cannot push directly to protected branches; changes must go through a Pull Request (PR).

Requiring Code Reviews: Mandates a minimum number of peer approvals before merging.

Enforcing Status Checks: Requires specific CI workflows to pass before the merge button becomes active.

Goal: Prevents accidental overwrites, unauthorized changes, and unreviewed code from entering production branches.

How They Work Together
Branch protection rules provide the enforcement, while gate tests provide the verification:

                                  Merged into Main!

A developer creates a Pull Request (PR) to merge code into main.

Branch Protection halts the merge and waits for checks.

The Gate Test runs automatically via CI workflow to test the new code.

If the gate test passes AND required PR reviews are approved, Branch Protection allows the merge. If any test fails, the merge button stays locked.
